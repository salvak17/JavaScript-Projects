    <body>
        <p>The defer.js file will be getting the info below to display an alert using the defer attribute.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="defer_ex">This is an alert window</p>
        <br>
        <p>The alert window was able to say "This is an alert window" because, the defer attribute was used 
            and able to let the HTML document load before executing the defer.js file; that way the defer.js
            file can pull the info after the HTML file was loaded.</p>
